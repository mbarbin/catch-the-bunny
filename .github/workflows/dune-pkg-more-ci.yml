# Additional CI workflow using setup-dune (dune package management).
# This workflow is intended to eventually replace more-ci.yml.
#
# Compared to dune-pkg-ci.yml, this tests across multiple operating systems
# and OCaml versions, but skips steps not necessary for every combination
# (linting, coverage, etc.).
#
# Since setup-dune doesn't support setting the ocaml-version directly, we:
# 1. Substitute the ocaml constraint in dune-workspace using the matrix variable
# 2. Add the ocaml-version to dune-project to differentiate cache keys per version
