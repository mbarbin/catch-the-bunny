;; Adding the `pkg` stanza may be done by the CI when running nightly however
;; the presence of the lock dir shall be sufficient to signal that pkg
;; management is enabled.

;; This stanza requires 3.21 which is currently not available in the setup-ocaml
;; part of the CI in this project, so we're keeping 3.20 for now. We'll revisit
;; later.
